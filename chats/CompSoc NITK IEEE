@all, I tried but due to unavailability of rooms, we cannot have the evalution on Thursday. It has to be tomorrow at 7:30. I will post the schedule soon. I understand that its a hectic day for all of you with project submissions coming up as well. I assure you that we wont be very strict during the presentation. Present whatever you have/have not done honestly and have a plan for the upcoming semester ready. PPT is not needed. You can explain with code. :)
This is regarding all the projects??
Yes.
Schedule for the evals today:
7:30- Porting FreeBSD to Android
7:40 - Data analysis of accident prone areas
7:50 - Gane public goods in network
8:00 - Deep learning for NLP
8:10 - Age and gender classification
