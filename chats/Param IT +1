Should I go for this,?
Hey
This looks nice, I didn't know India had its own GTCx
Whether or not you should go depends on your interests I guess 😛
No I'm interested. I just want to know if it will be worth it.
But if you do stay in Mumbai, no reason not to right?
🙈
As is it legit.
GTC is legit
I stay in Mumbai. Half an hour from this place.
🙈
Oh awesome.
I don't think there's an entry fee for students
So the only thing you're investing is time 😛
It's 500. But I don't mind paying as long as I learn something.
🙈
Yeah.
Thanks man. 😁
There was a free pass for students option
Maybe I missed that. 🙈
